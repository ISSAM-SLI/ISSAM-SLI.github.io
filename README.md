## About the Project 💡 <a name="about-the-project"></a>

<div style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9); padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <p>The <strong>Weather App</strong> was inspired by my need for a simple and efficient tool that can provide fast and accurate weather updates. As someone who is always on the go, I wanted to create a tool that is easy to use and can work across all devices without hassle.</p>

    <h4>Inspiration and Process</h4>
    <p>This project is part of my <strong>Portfolio Project</strong> for Holberton School, where I had the opportunity to bring my skills in front-end and back-end development together. The timeline for this project was <strong>3 weeks</strong>, during which I planned, designed, and coded this entire application by myself.</p>
    <p>The project helped me strengthen my knowledge in <strong>APIs</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>CSS styling</strong> while also focusing on <strong>user experience</strong> and <strong>responsive design</strong>.</p>
