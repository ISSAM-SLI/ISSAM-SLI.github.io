## About the Project üí° <a name="about-the-project"></a>

The **Weather App** was inspired by my need for a simple and efficient tool that can provide fast and accurate weather updates. As someone who is always on the go, I wanted to create a tool that is easy to use and can work across all devices without hassle.

### Inspiration and Process
This project is part of my **Portfolio Project** for Holberton School, where I had the opportunity to bring my skills in front-end and back-end development together. The timeline for this project was **3 weeks**, during which I planned, designed, and coded this entire application by myself.  

The project helped me strengthen my knowledge in **APIs**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS styling** while also focusing on **user experience** and **responsive design**.
